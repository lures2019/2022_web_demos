### Talk at First

Hello everybody,I'm glad to know that you're watching my github!This folder is using to record all programs that I have written in web learning!Among them,there are some notes according to the cource,but it's not record by me ,it's the teacher and I think is very detailed and useful!So you can review with it which will play a great role in your web learning.In fact ,I make a plan to learn all this web course in two months for get a great job between Feb. to Apr.. I will review yesterday's content through reading the docx and ppt,of course,I won't forget to do every practice to enhance my understanding.



### What in it

​	For example,the folder named NOTES is a summary about today's course! The leftover other folders are all programs that the teacher tells us to do.
